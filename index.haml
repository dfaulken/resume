      The Internet generally being a less formal setting than a PDF document
      (and certainly more flexible when it comes to presentation of content),
      I thought it might be nice to share some brief context about various items
      I mention here.

      While the focus of my position is on PVTA projects largely unrelated
      to UMass Transit, we feel at Transit that it's important for staff throughout
      the organization to maintain a meaningful connection to everyday operations.

      As a student, I committed to driving a regular fixed-route shift at least
      once per week &mdash; and similarly, in this professional position, I still attend weekly
      staff meetings and participate in an operations on-call rotation.

      More details coming soon (once I get more into the swing of the things).
