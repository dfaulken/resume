      The Internet generally being a less formal setting than a PDF document
      (and certainly more flexible when it comes to presentation of content),
      I thought it might be nice to share some brief context about various items
      I mention here.

    .comment-text{ data: { id: 1 } }
      While the focus of my position is on PVTA projects largely unrelated
      to UMass Transit, we feel at Transit that it's important for staff throughout
      the organization to maintain a meaningful connection to everyday operations.
      %br

      As a student, I committed to driving a regular fixed-route shift at least
      once per week &mdash; and similarly, in this professional position, I still attend weekly
      staff meetings and participate in an operations on-call rotation.
    .comment-text{ data: { id: 2 } }
      More details coming soon (once I get more into the swing of the things).
    .comment-text{ data: { id: 3 } }
      This was actually the only project that I wasn't involved with while I was lead developer.
      One of our brilliant student developers (and a fellow class of '17 graduate!),
      Aaron Kaplowitz, spearheaded the implementation of that app.
      %br

      My role was largely to step back, allocate Ruby on Rails work to other team members,
      and let the Angular / ionic / cordova team do their thing.
    .comment-text{ data: { id: 4 } }
      This is one of UMass Transit's few private respositories, for largely historical reasons.
      %br
      %br
      Suffice it to say that it has 86 object models,
      several controllers with over a thousand lines of code,
      and has been contributed to by 23 developers since its inception in August 2011.
      It has been live since May 10th, 2013.
      %br
      %br
      As of May 2017, I am the primary contributor, with nearly 2,900 commits,
      having added 91,000+ lines and deleted 66,000+ lines.
    .comment-text{ data: { id: 5 } }
      My role was usually the design, architecture, and Agile prototyping.
      %br
      %br
      Once the apps were deployed to production, I would then delegate the remaining
      non-blocking issues to senior and junior (training) developers.
      %br
      %br
      During my two years as lead, there were between 9 and 12 such projects, depending on
      whether you count projects which were developed, but never used meaningfully.
