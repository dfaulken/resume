The Internet generally being a less formal setting than a PDF document
(and certainly more flexible when it comes to presentation of content),
I thought it might be nice to share some brief context about various items
I mention here.

While the focus of my position is on PVTA projects largely unrelated
to UMass Transit, we feel at Transit that it's important for staff throughout
the organization to maintain a meaningful connection to everyday operations.
<br>
<br>
As a student, I committed to driving a regular fixed-route shift at least
once per week &mdash; and similarly, in this professional position, I still attend weekly
staff meetings and participate in an operations on-call rotation.
</div>
<div class='comment-text' data-id='2'>
More details coming soon (once I get more into the swing of things).

This was actually the only project that I wasn't involved with while I was lead developer.
One of our brilliant student developers (and a fellow class of '17 graduate!),
<a href='https://github.com/akaplo'>Aaron Kaplowitz</a>,
spearheaded the implementation of that app.
<br>
<br>
My role was largely to step back, allocate Ruby on Rails work to other team members,
and let the Angular / ionic / cordova team do their thing.
</div>
<div class='comment-text' data-id='4'>
This is one of UMass Transit's few private respositories, for largely historical reasons.
<br>
<br>
Suffice it to say that it has 86 object models,
several controllers and models with over a thousand lines of code,
and has been contributed to by 23 developers since its inception in August 2011.
It has been live since May 10th, 2013.
<br>
<br>
As of May 2017, I am the primary contributor, with nearly 2,900 commits,
having added 91,000+ lines and deleted 66,000+ lines.
</div>

My role was usually the design, architecture, and Agile prototyping.
<br>
<br>
Once the apps were deployed to production, I would then delegate the remaining
non-blocking issues to senior and junior (training) developers.
<br>
<br>
During my two years as lead, there were between 9 and 12 such projects, depending on
whether you count projects which were developed, but never used meaningfully.

I later
<a href='https://slides.com/davidfaulkenberry/cs320-geek-talk'>repeated</a>
this talk to a group of computer science undergraduates, while enrolled
in a graduate course in software engineering project management.
</div>
<div class='comment-text' data-id='7'>
This ended up being an abortive project. We eventually decided to go in a different
direction after about a year of development, with counsel from a very experienced
Transit Services alumnus.
<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, it was an extremely valuable learning experience: both from a management perspective,
in terms of leading a large team through the green-field implementation of a relatively abstract, ephemeral idea;
as well as from a design perspective, in that a Ruby on Rails microservices system didn't really exist.
(As far as I'm aware, this is still true.)
